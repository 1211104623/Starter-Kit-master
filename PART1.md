## Problems Encountered & Solutions

The problem that we faced while doing this assignment is we had a really hard time trying to put the Alien in the middle of the board game and putting the correct number of zombies on the board game. so, because of this, balqis had a really hard time trying to do her part which is the game controls and our plan for part 1 is to submit until the game controls but we could not. we are still trying to find solutions so that we could submit everything in part 2 later on.

A problem that we face is the github process. we had problem when we try to enter 'git --version' in command prompt, then it comes out ''git' is not recognised as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file'. we tried to get help from our friend. our group member, uzma manage to do it. however, azizah and balqis could not do it.
however, when uzma tries to continues with the lab00 part3, she encounters another problem where when she enters 'git init' in the terminal, suppose there be only one file (according to the slides) in the source control. but, she had 10000 files instead ;). she then tries to do everything again from beginning. but almost the same problem appeared where now the is no file at all and her cpp files does not have the letter 'U'. but she continued following the slides until slide number 65, where she had another problem since her vscode does not have the staged changes in the source control. she then ask sir william for help.
